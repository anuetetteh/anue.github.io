                <h4><u>Cleaning and Sanitization</u></h4>
                The collected eggs are cleaned to remove dirt, feathers, or manure from the shells.
                This is often done using automated washing systems that spray the eggs with warm water and a mild
                sanitizing solution.
                This ensures the eggs are free of harmful bacteria like Salmonella and visually appealing to consumers.
                Cleaning not only enhances hygiene but also extends the shelf life of the eggs.
                After washing, the eggs are dried to prevent moisture from promoting bacterial growth.

                <h4><u>Candling and Quality Inspection</u></h4>
                Eggs pass through a candling machine, where a light is shone through them to inspect their internal
                quality.
                Trained personnel check for cracks, blood spots, or irregularities in the yolk and white.
                They identify eggs that meet quality standards and removes defective ones.
                This process ensures only high-quality eggs reach the market, maintaining consumer trust and food safety
                standards.

            <div class="box"><h4><u>Grading and Packaging</u></h4>
                Eggs are sorted based on size, weight, and grade (e.g., Grade A, B, or jumbo size). 
                They are then packaged into cartons or trays with proper labeling.
                The main purposeof this is that it standardizes the eggs for sale, making them appealing and easy for consumers to purchase.
                Proper grading helps meet market regulations and consumer preferences. 
                Packaging protects the eggs during transportation and provides important information like expiration dates.

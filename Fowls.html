                <h4><u>Processing (Slaughtering and Cleaning)</u></h4>
                This involves the humane slaughtering of chickens in a regulated environment. 
                Once slaughtered, the chickens are cleaned to remove feathers, blood, and internal organs.
                Automated systems or manual methods are used to defeather the birds.
                The carcasses are then washed and sanitized to meet food safety standards.
                Which ensures the chickens are hygienic and free of contaminants.
                </P>

                <h4><u>Chilling and Quality Control</u></h4>
                After cleaning, the chickens are rapidly chilled to a specific temperature to prevent 
                bacterial growth and maintain freshness.
                Chilling is done using methods like water immersion or air-chilling.
                Quality checks are conducted to ensure the chickens meet regulatory and customer standards, 
                including checking for proper weight and appearance.
                Maintains product quality, safety, and freshness.

            <div class="box">
                <h4><u>Packaging and Labeling</u></h4>
                The processed chickens are portioned (e.g., whole birds, cuts, or fillets) and vacuum-sealed or wrapped in food-grade packaging.
                Labels are added to provide details like weight, expiration date, nutritional information, and origin.
                Packaged products may also undergo further freezing or storage until transportation.
                This process prepares the chickens for transportation while preserving freshness and providing consumers with essential product details.

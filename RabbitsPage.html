                <h4><u>Health Inspection and Certification</u></h4>
                Rabbits are examined to ensure they are healthy and free from diseases. 
                For meat rabbits, this includes veterinary inspections to confirm they meet food safety standards. 
                For live pet rabbits, a health check ensures they are in good physical condition.
                To comply with health and safety regulations and maintain consumer confidence.
                This step ensures that only healthy rabbits are sent to the market, protecting consumers and maintaining ethical standards.

                </P>

                <h4><u>Cleaning and Processing (for Meat)</u></h4>
                Rabbits intended for meat are humanely slaughtered, cleaned, and processed in a controlled environment. 
                This includes skinning, gutting, and cutting the meat into portions.
                This is to prepare the product for consumption while adhering to hygiene standards.
                Proper cleaning and processing ensure that the meat is safe to eat and meets quality standards for market sale.
            </div>
            <div class="box"><h4><u>Grading and Packaging</u></h4>
                The rabbits (whether meat or live pets) are graded based on size, weight, and quality. 
                For meat, the portions are vacuum-sealed or placed in labeled packages. 
                For live rabbits, they are placed in appropriate crates with adequate ventilation and care instructions.
                To standardize the product and make it appealing and convenient for buyers.
                Proper grading and packaging ensure that the rabbits are ready for transport and sale, 
                maintaining their quality and ensuring safe delivery.
